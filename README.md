Applying machine learning techniques for financial data analysis.

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used for grouping data into "clusters" and identify hidden structures in unlabeled data.

In this paper, we will apply the K-Means clustering algorithm in order to cluster stocks. This application of the K-Means algorithm can be useful in the context of risk management for portfolio construction. Grouping stocks into clusters that have similar performance and risk profiles over a given time period is helpful to build a diversified portfolio and reduce risk exposure. In addition, it can be useful if we want to expose our portfolio to one specific segment of the market.

By using this method, investors can make more informed decisions about which stock to invest in and how to allocate their portfolios.


Portfolio construction with one stock from each cluster that has the highest RAM (Risk Adjusted Momentum). 

RAM = Return / Vol
